Due to the extensive constituency changes ahead of the 2010 election, the database will have to be updated outside the usual schedule. Also the new data has not been supplied in the usual format so we are having to write one-off import routines to tidy up the database ahead of May 6th.

1. Perform db migrations to change ons_id from an int to a 3 varchar string

bc. rake db:migrate

2. Patch supplied data file to remove duplicate constituencies

3. Generate a new constituencies file

bc. rake fymp:create_new_constituencies_file

4. Patch new constituencies file to correct truncated constituency names

5. Drop current postcodes and constituency data

bc. truncate table postcodes;
truncate table constituencies;

6. Import new constituencies and check that there are 650 of them

bc. rake fymp:constituencies

7. Generate a postcodes.txt file based on the August 2009 data

bc. rake fymp:parse_postcodes source=data/NSPDC_AUG_2009_UK_1M.txt

8. Run a task to compare the postcodes.txt file with the new data to produce a postcodes.txt file containing only valid postcodes against the new ONS constituency ids

bc. rake fymp:parse_new_postcodes old_file=data/postcodes.txt newfile=data/pcd_pcon_aug_2009_uk_lu.txt output=data/new_postcodes.txt

9. Once we have a valid file, we need to rename the files so that they can be used in the next step of the process

bc. mv postcodes.txt postcodes_aug09.txt
cp new_postcodes.txt postcodes.txt

At this stage, we can run one of the regular import tasks

10. Import our new postcode.txt file into the database - warning this may take several hours

bc. rake fymp:populate

(As the system wasn't designed to run against a constituency table with null member data, we are anticipating that we may also need to manually alter the constituencies table - or change the default values - to set some of the fields to blank strings instead of null with member_visible set to 0 to make sure everything works properly through all areas of the site)
